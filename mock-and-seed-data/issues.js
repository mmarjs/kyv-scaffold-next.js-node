      <h3>Where we live shapes our lives. But what kind of housing is built, where, and how much it costs are all complicated questions. Here are three ways in which City Government plays a role in managing housing in Toronto.</h3>
      <h3>1. City Government Approves Proposals for New Housing Development</h3>
      <p>City Government is responsible for approving or rejecting proposals for all new buildings, including houses, condos, and apartments. This process helps align everything that gets built in Toronto with the City’s Official Plan and zoning by-law, which are approved by City Council.</p>
      <p>City Government considers many different things when making decisions about what can be built where. The city needs enough new houses, condos, and apartments to keep up with population growth and the demand for housing. But development can also bring challenges — it can change the character of neighbourhoods too quickly, or make it hard for schools, streets, water pipes, parks, and transit to meet the needs of all new residents.</p>
      <p>The City Planning Division's website has a lot of information, including new building proposals, the City’s Official Plan, and the ways you can get involved in the planning process.</p>
      <p><b>Facts about Housing Development in Toronto:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toronto is growing. Each day, an average of 100 new housing units get built in the city.1</li>
        <li>The cost of a home is rising. In 2010, the average cost of a house or condo in Toronto was over $450,000. In 2017, the average cost had risen to over $775,000. Even if we take inflation into account, prices have gone up by 65% over the last 7 years.2</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2. City Government Provides Community Housing</h3>
      <p>City Government provides housing assistance, often referred to as community, affordable, or social housing. Community housing offers rent support to people who need help paying their monthly rent. The main provider of community housing is the Toronto Community Housing Corporation, but other types of community housing also exist.</p>
      <p>The City has a useful learning guide that explains all the ways they provide affordable housing. Learn more about the different definitions of affordable housing here and here.</p>
      <p><b>Facts about Community Housing in Toronto:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Toronto Community Housing Corporation is the largest community housing provider in Canada. It operates 2,100 buildings and houses 110,000 residents.3</li>
        <li>Waitlists have been growing.4 Close to 100,000 people are currently on a waitlist to receive some form of community housing support. Over the last 10 years, the waitlist has grown, on average, about 3% per year.5</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. City Government Operates Emergency Shelters</h3>
      <p>The City runs emergency shelters, which offer beds to people who don’t have housing. You can view the nightly occupancy rates for emergency shelters here.</p>
      <p><b>Facts about Emergency Shelters in Toronto:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Demand has risen and shelters are often full. In May 2018, on average, 7,000 people used an emergency shelter bed every night compared with 4,500 people one year earlier.6 On average, over 90% of emergency shelter beds are used each night in Toronto.7</li>
        <li>1000 new shelter beds are being created in the next 3 years. During the 2018 budget process, Council approved funding to open 1,000 new shelter beds over the next three years.8</li>
      </ul>

    question:
      'What should the next City Council do about transportation and how we get around Toronto? Why?',

      <h3>We’ve all got places to go. How does Toronto’s City Government help us get from Point A to Point B?</h3>
      <h3>What does City Government do?</h3>
      <p>City Government plays a number of important roles in our transportation system.</p>

      <p><b>The City Government:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Builds, fixes, and runs the TTC, our city’s public transit system.</li>
        <li>Builds and fixes roads and sidewalks.</li>
        <li>Decides how we use our streets by setting speed limits and choosing where traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and dedicated bike and transit lanes go.</li>
        <li>Manages parking on streets and in Green P lots.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Government of Ontario's responsibilities include the GO Trains and the 400-Series Highways</p>
      <p>City Government also approves where offices, homes, and stores get built. Over time, this can have a big impact on how we get around for two reasons. First: getting the right mix of jobs, stores, and homes in each neighbourhood means residents take shorter trips. Second: Putting more jobs and homes close to major transit stations decreases public transit commuting times.</p>

      <h3>How does Toronto’s commute compare?</h3>
      <p>Here’s how Toronto compares to Montreal, Vancouver, and five international cities with similar regional populations. Amongst this group, Toronto has longest public transit commute time, and is in the middle of the pack when comparing the time drivers spend in traffic jams.1</p>
      <p>These are only two of the many ways we can compare commutes between cities. This report looks at other indicators.</p>

      <h3>Our region is growing, and our transportation system is too.</h3>
      <p>As our city and region grow, more people are using our city’s sidewalks, roads, buses, streetcars, subways, and GO Trains to get around.</p>
      <p>Toronto grows by about 20,000 people each year, and the areas around Toronto grow by another 45,000 people each year.2</p>
      <p>While the City Government is responsible for building and fixing its own streets and sidewalks, big transit and transportation projects that benefit the region are often developed in partnership with the Governments of Ontario and Canada, and sometimes with other municipalities as well. Often, more than one government contributes funding to make these projects a reality.</p>

      <p><b>For example: here is the funding breakdown for the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>$697 million: Government of Canada's contribution</li>
        <li>$974 million: Government of Ontario contribution</li>
        <li>$904 million: City of Toronto contribution</li>
        <li>$604 million: York Region contribution</li>
        <li>Total Cost: $3.2 billion3</li>
      </ul>

      <p>An Ontario government agency called Metrolinx coordinates with governments across the region to help figure out what transportation projects get built first. Metrolinx also runs the regional GO Transit system. Metrolinx has created a regional plan for growing our transportation system.</p>
